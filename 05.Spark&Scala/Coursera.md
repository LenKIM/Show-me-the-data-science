## Mac OS X

Mac OS X either comes with a pre-installed JDK, or installs it automatically.

To verify your JDK installation, open the Terminal application in /Applications/Utilities/ and type java -version. If the JDK is not yet installed, the system will ask you if you would like to download and install it. Make sure you install Java 1.8.



## Installing sbt

[Follow the instructions for your platform here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html) to get it running.

This course requires sbt version **>0.13.x**. If you have previously installed sbt 0.12.x, you need to uninstall it and install a newer version. sbt 0.13.x or newer can be used for projects and other courses requiring sbt 0.12.x, but not the other way around. If in doubt, you can check your currently installed sbt like this: in an arbitrary directory that is not a programming assignment or otherwise an sbt project, run:

```
$ sbt about

#This is sbt 1.1.0
```



## sbt usage

1. Starting up sbt  
   : ln order to start sbt, open a terminal ("Command Prompt" in Windows) and navigate to the directory of the assignment you are working on. Typing sbt will open the sbt command prompt.

```shell
shell$ cd /path/to/progfun-project-directory                        # This is the shell of the operating system
shell$ sbt
> _                                                                 # This is the sbt shell
```

2. Running the Scala Interpreter  
   : You can start the Scala interpreter inside sbt using the console task. The interpreter (also called REPL, for "read-eval-print loop") is useful for trying out snippets of Scala code. Note that the interpreter can only be started if there are no compilation errors in your code.

   In order to quit the interpreter and get back to sbt, type ctrl-d.

   ```
   > console
   [info] Starting scala interpreter...
   Welcome to Scala version 2.11.5 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_04-ea).
   Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
   Type :help for more information.
   
   scala> println("Oh, hai!")                                          # This is the Scala REPL, type some Scala code
   Oh, hai!
   
   scala> val l = List(1, 2, 3)
   l: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
   
   scala> val squares = l.map(x => x * x)
   squares: List[Int] = List(1, 4, 9)
   
   scala>                                                              # Type [ctrl-d] to exit the Scala REPL

   ```

3. Compiling your Code  

   ```sh
   > compile
   [info] Compiling 4 Scala sources to /Users/aleksandar/example/target/scala-2.11/classes...
   [success] Total time: 1 s, completed Mar 21, 2013 11:04:46 PM

   ```

   

4. Testing your Code

```shell
> test
[info] ListsSuite:
[info] - one plus one is two
[info] - sum of a few numbers *** FAILED ***
[info]   3 did not equal 2 (ListsSuite.scala:23)
[info] - max of a few numbers
[error] Failed: : Total 3, Failed 1, Errors 0, Passed 2, Skipped 0
[error] Failed tests:

```

4. Submitting your Solution to Coursera

The sbt task submit allows you to submit your solution for the assignment. It will pack your source code into a .jar file and upload it to the coursera servers. Note that the code can only be submitted if there are no compilation errors.

The submit tasks takes two arguments: your Coursera e-mail address and the submission password. **NOTE**: the submission password is **not your login password**. Instead, it's a special password generated by coursera for each assignment. It is available on the right side of the assignment page.

```shell
> submit e-mail@university.org suBmISsioNPasSwoRd
